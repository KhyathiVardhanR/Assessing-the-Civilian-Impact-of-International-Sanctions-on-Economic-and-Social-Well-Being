# Assessing the Civilian Impact of International Sanctions on Economic and Social Well-Being

## Project Overview

This project investigates how **international sanctions** affect the welfare of civilian populations.
Rather than studying whether sanctions achieve their political goals, the project asks:
**Do sanctions harm ordinary people, and through what economic channels do these effects operate?**

### Research Question
> How do international sanctions affect civilian economic and social well-being over time,
> through what economic transmission mechanisms do these effects operate, and do these pressures
> coincide with political instability or government turnover?

### Conceptual Framework
```
Sanctions
  → Trade restrictions & financial constraints
  → Import/export contraction (food, medicine, energy)
  → Price instability & macroeconomic stress
  → Poverty & household welfare decline
  → Child health & education outcomes
```

## Final Outcome (Milestone 3)

### Deployed Tool
The project is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** (`app.py`) that allows users to:
- Explore the country-year panel dataset with filters
- Visualize sanction impacts on child mortality, education, and unemployment
- Compare three machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Examine fixed-effects regression results (causal inference)
- Explore event-study dynamics around sanction onset
- Review heterogeneous effects by regime type and sanction type

**To run the dashboard locally:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Variable Selection

### Dependent Variable (Primary Target)
**`child_mortality_u5`** — Under-5 child mortality rate per 1,000 live births

Justification:
- Captures food security, healthcare access, sanitation, and poverty simultaneously
- Best data completeness among welfare outcomes (only 9.5% missing)
- Directly sensitive to policy channels targeted by sanctions (medicine, food imports)
- Internationally comparable across countries and years

### Independent Variables (Treatment)
- **`sanction_active`** — Binary indicator (1 = sanctions imposed, 0 = no sanctions)
- **`sanction_intensity_index`** — Continuous 0–1 scale of sanction severity

Using both captures threshold effects (any sanction) and dose-response effects (severity).

### Control Variables
| Variable | Role |
|----------|------|
| `gdp_growth` | Economic performance confounder |
| `inflation_rate` | Price instability indicator |
| `conflict_incidence` | Distinguish sanction effects from war shocks |
| `conflict_intensity` | Severity of armed conflict |
| `regime_score` | Political system type (Polity V) |
| `unemployment_rate` | Labor market conditions |
| `log_total_trade_exposure` | Trade openness |

### Secondary Outcomes
- `school_enrollment` — Human capital investment
- `unemployment_rate` — Labor market impact

## Key Findings

Findings come from **5 civilian well-being outcomes** across health, education, gender equity, and economic dimensions, plus a composite index combining all five.

| Dimension | Outcome | Unadjusted Gap | FE Within-Country Effect | Significant? |
|-----------|---------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Health | child_mortality_u5 | Higher in sanctioned countries | +0.64 per 1,000 | No (p=0.69) |
| Education | school_enrollment | Lower in sanctioned countries | +0.05 pp | No (p=0.97) |
| Gender equity | Girls enrollment | Lower in sanctioned countries | +0.52 pp | No (p=0.67) |
| Economic | unemployment_rate | Higher in sanctioned countries | −0.16 pp | No (p=0.68) |
| Price stability | inflation_rate | Higher in sanctioned countries | +3.37 pp | No (p=0.24) |
| **Composite** | Well-Being Index (0–100) | 94.2 vs 94.8 (≈ no gap) | Near zero | No |

**Core Finding:** After controlling for country fixed effects (which absorbs all pre-existing country-level differences), sanctions have NO statistically significant within-country effect on any of the five well-being outcomes. The unadjusted descriptive gap is driven by **selection bias** — countries targeted by sanctions were already poorer and more vulnerable before sanctions were imposed.

1. **Best predictive model:** Gradient Boosting — Validation R²=0.83, Test R²=0.65
2. **Top predictors:** Female primary enrollment, poverty rate, school enrollment
3. **Event study:** Child mortality declines over the sanction window — tracking the global trend; no sharp break at onset
4. **Policy implication:** Humanitarian relief programs for sanctioned populations need to address pre-existing structural vulnerability, not only the sanctions themselves

## Heilmeier Catechism

**What are you trying to do?**
Evaluate whether international sanctions cause measurable civilian welfare harm, and through what economic channels.

**How is it done today, and what are the limits?**
Existing research relies on GDP/inflation proxies and simple comparisons without panel identification strategies.

**What is new in your approach?**
Integration of four datasets, fixed-effects panel regression, event-study design, and multi-outcome analysis into a deployed interactive tool.

**Who cares?**
Policymakers, humanitarian organizations, international relations researchers, and civilians in sanctioned countries.

**If successful, what difference will it make?**
A rigorous, reproducible framework for evaluating sanction impacts on civilian populations, moving beyond anecdotal accounts.
